	- This directory contains Rmarkdowns that plot and interrogate the results from PCAngsd/NGSadmix for the filtered samples to 
investigate population structure and to define 'populations' by combining closely related sample sites.
	

./$DATA/scripts
	- Contains a script which plots the results from running PCAngsd and NGSadmix on the filtered (i.e. f5 for exome and f7 for 
chr21) samples.
	- The exome and chr21 results agree very closely.
	- "Populations" are defined by combining closely related sample sites in the exome script. 

./exome/output
Outputs from the exome Rmarkdown scripts defining "populations".
