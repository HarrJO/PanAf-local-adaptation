This directory should contain the PanAf BAMs for chr21 and exome data containing only mapped on target reads (mapped to hg19). If it doesn't, its due to space restraints. They are backed up on the UCL RDSS cluster.

exomes: /mnt/gpfs/live/ritd-ag-project-rd00q6-aanda24/ChimpanzeeAdaptation/PanAf/Data/PanAf_phase1and2_exomes/BAM.mapped.on.target
chr21: /mnt/gpfs/live/ritd-ag-project-rd00q6-aanda24/ChimpanzeeAdaptation/PanAf/Data/PanAf_phase1and2_chr21/BAMs
